1. [Fluent Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluentform/)
2. [WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) (Elite or Lifetime)

**What would you do if you discover the contracts you used in running your online business were not legally binding?**

= Electronic Signature Add-on for Fluent Forms =

Imagine being in a courtroom with an estranged client who’s claiming that they never agreed to your contract.  You pull up the contract and after a brief review, the judge announces that the esignature used in the contract was not legally valid.  He then asks if you have anything else to support your case.

Hopefully it will never come to to this, but if it did, what would you do?

Well, there’s not much you could do.

**The electronic document industry has very strict rules and regulations for legal contracts, invoices, employee agreements and any other legally binding document you may use in your business.**

**Fluent Forms is a terrific WordPress Form Plugin!** It is quite possibly one of the best ways to automate any number of tasks using a WordPress website (and of course their renowned contact forms plugin). However, *signing legally binding contracts is NOT Fluent Forms primary focus* (it is however ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature sole focus). We have invested many years building a system that adheres to the strictest [UETA and ESIGN](https://aprv.me/fluentforms) nationwide and foreign document signing regulations.   

*This Signature Pad Plugin fills the gap between a WordPress Form plugin and an esignature solution that is compliant with the UETA/ESIGN guidelines.*

Digital security is crucial to your business.  You need to protect yourself from anything that could call your forms into question.

**The ApproveMe WordPress E-Signature Plugin turns your WordPress site into a court recognized document signing app.**

If you’re a Fluent Forms user, you know how powerful their plugin can be to help automate a number of tasks on your website.  HOWEVER, signing legally binding contracts is NOT their primary focus.  That’s where we come in.

The Fluent Forms Digital Signature Add-On ensures that every contact form, contract, or invoice submitted with the WP Form plugin is 100% UETA/ESIGN compliant.

No more second-guessing the legality of your contracts or needing to use a third-party signing service.

We’ve invested years into building a system that adheres the strictest nationwide and foreign document signing regulations while allowing you to control your user experience.  

You get a 100% legally compliant signature on file to protect you and the customer, without having to worry about users getting distracted or being unsecure on third party sites.

**How this esignature & WordPress Contract Plugin is different than a typical Fluent Forms WordPress signature pad addon** 
Most signature pad plugins simply record signature details and submit the data to a web server where it is converted to a PNG or JPEG file.  This graphic file then gets saved on your FTP server.

This image file of your client’s hand-written legal signature — the same one used to buy houses, sign up for credit cards, and obtain business loans — is easily accessible to any FTP intruders.

Here’s the problem:  

Most of these plugins are not legally binding (much less UETA/ESIGN compliant) as they fail to address the countless laws and regulations that guide the document signing industry.

If the legality of your contract were to ever come into question, you wouldn’t have much to stand alone.  And if fraud or identity theft were ever an issue, you would have a tough time proving your case with a signature that the courts don’t recognize.  Why risk it?

**ApproveMe’s brand new signature add-on found at [ApproveMe.com](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) it is the connection point between a WordPress forms plugin and having a UETA / ESIGN compliant WordPress contract plugin that runs on your WordPress site.**

**Check out the video clip above to find out ways to save time and money by fully automating legal contracts for your website design, digital photography, freelance or consulting business making use of our Fluent Forms Digital Signature Add-On.**

=MORE ON HOW THIS UETA/ESIGN COMPLIANT WORDPRESS FORM SIGNATURE PLUGIN WORKS=

**[ApproveMe’s Signature Add-On for Fluent Forms](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) generates a UETA/ESIGN compliant court recognized contract with (optional) details/field values inserted anywhere you want them inserted in the contract.  These dynamic field values are taken from the submitted form of your end user.

Your form submitter can either draw or type their legal  signature using their mouse, trackpad, tablet or smartphone.  All of this magic happens the instant an end user submits a WP Form by either emailing a signer specific invitation to their contract or immediately redirecting the end users.**

Another highly popular use case is pre-filling contract data that might change from contract to contract. Say for instance, you are a Web Design agency and you have a standard contract you send out that varies ever so slightly every time you bring on a new client. Maybe you have optional packages available that need to be noted in your contract. But creating a new contract from scratch is incredibly time consuming.
 
With this Electronic Signature Add-on for Fluent Forms + ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature (business license) you can create a WP Form with the fields and sections of the contract that vary and add an additional field for the “Signers Name” + “Signers Email.” 

Your Fluent Form would look something like:

DROPDOWN FIELD 1  = Dropdown of available packages
PARAGRAPH FIELD 2 = Classes or terms that vary from contract to contract
TEXT FIELD 2 = SIGNERS FULL NAME
TEXT FIELD 3 = SIGNERS EMAIL ADDRESS

You would insert these WP Field values in your WP E-Signature contract in the proper places or paragraphs that pertain to this information.
 
You would choose the option “Email this contact whenever this form is submitted.”

 Now, whenever you fill out this Fluent, your contract will be automatically generated with the custom terms from your WP Form submission and then a signer invitation email will be sent to the signer email address that was given in the WP Form submission.


*Additional benefits of ApproveMe’s WP eSign Plugin and this for Electronic Signature Add-on for Fluent Forms is that you are able to instantly create a legal contract for your clients to sign depending on their form information from a WPForm.*


**And that’s just the beginning. When a client signs…**


*… both you and the client will instantly get a PDF of the contract that they signed (eSignature automation at its finest).*


*…registering or sending your client to a third-party website to sign your legal contracts is not required (all signatures take place on your WordPress website… so the experience is on your site and not someone else’s)*

*… you’ll have a 100% legally compliant electronic signature on file to protect you AND the customer (according to UETA/ESIGN guidelines).*


###Fluent Forms Digital Signature add-on and WordPress Signature turns your site & WordPress Form into a court recognized document signing application (but without the monthly fees… and with unlimited amount of users).###
 
* Ideal for anyone who wants to automate signature collection on proposals, quotes, timesheets, service terms agreements, new client legal contracts, waiver forms and much more using a WordPress form! *

Immediately redirect your site visitors to sign a legally binding contract after submitting a WordPress Form that was created using Fluent Forms. 

“I agree to terms” checkboxes have the legal standing of a limp handshake. **Do the smart thing. Don’t get caught in a courtroom with a document that’s not legally binding.**

**The Powerful Features of ApproveMe’s Digital Signature Add-On for Fluent Forms:**


**ADDON FEATURES THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE**
WP E-Signature offers an incredibly in depth eSignature add-on collection with several easy to customize [Fluent Forms esignature automations](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) and [third-party integrations](https://www.approveme.com/esign-integrations?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) to even further improve your personalized document signing requirements.


=The WordPress contract plugin operates on every leading PC and web browsers for smart phones. For example Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari, Android, iOS, and WebOS.=


*Besides being user friendly, ApproveMe’s Fluent Forms WordPress Signature Plugin is able to instantly enter details which was posted from a WP Form into a UETA/ESIGN compliant and courtroom accepted contract form utilizing your own WordPress website.*


Therefore if you have a dropdown list of options in your WP Form named “Web Design Package” and you provide various products (different price points for each) it is possible to easily produce a legal contract which includes the package features of an order in the written agreement which is then sent to the end-user of your WP Form.


**Instantly Trigger Contracts To Be Sent** As soon as a client inputs data into and submits a WP form (that is connected to a WP E-Signature contract using this add-on) it is possible to instantly generate a Contract to be delivered either by email or by redirecting the signer to the contract immediately as the “thank you page.”


**Connect Fluent Forms Digital Signature With WP E-Signature** This Fluent Forms Add-On will blend the powerful automation attributes of WP forms with the eSignature features and peace of mind offered with WP E-Signature.


**Include Fluent Form Field Values Inside A WP E-Signature Contract**  With WP E-Signature’s Fluent Forms Electronic Signature Add-On, you are able to input submitted form information into a legal contract that is activated immediately as soon as a client submits a WP Form.


**Redirect a User to a Electronic Signature Contract after Submitting a WP Form**  After a user successfully submits a WP Form they can be immediately be rerouted to the contract of your choosing by using this E Signature add-on.


**Sends your Client a Contract Via Email Once they Complete a WP Form** After correctly submitting the WP Form, there is the option to email the form submitter a contract (or perhaps a different customer if the additional customer's email and name was in the recently completed WP form).


**Signing Reminder Emails triggered by your Contact Form** In the event that a customer has not yet electrically signed the contract which you were requesting them to sign after sending in your WP form, it is possible to instantly trigger signing reminder emails where you can choose the trigger date, the frequency of reminder emails, and the expiration date of the signing reminder emails.

###How Fluent Forms Digital Signature Pad Add-On by WP E-Signature Works:###


*The plugin for Fluent Forms is very simple to setup. With an active ApproveMe business license, you can instantly produce a legally binding (court accepted) contract utilizing completed Fluent Forms data and require your Fluent Forms submitter to add their signature on your WordPress E-Signature generated contract.*

This plugin is amazing for Freelancers, Web Designers, Photographers and Small Business owners who want to simplify their contract generation process.


###Get started by following these simple Fluent Forms WordPress E-Signature Plugin setup steps###


**Step 1:**
ApproveMe's WP E Signature requires a few more plugins/add-ons to help you release the full power and automate Fluent Forms as well as Digital Signatures that are legally binding. The following plugins are required:


1. [Fluent Forms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluentform/)
2. [WP E Signature](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) (Lifetime or Elite license)
3. [esignature Business Pack](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-signature-special/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) (comes with your license above)
4. [Signature Add-On by ApproveMe](this plugin)

*An Lifetime or Elite license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms)

**Step 2:**
*Input your ApproveMe license*
After you’ve purchased a business license from ApproveMe, you must input your new license key to launch upgrades and access technical support.


Log into your account to download your license key [ApproveMe account](https://www.approveme.com/sign-in/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) here (your password is included in the receipt emailed to you)


**Step 3:**
*Set up a blank WordPress page*
Once the WP E-Signature plugins and add-ons have been installed and your configurations are saved, you must set up a blank WordPress webpage for every Stand Alone Document (or contract) you will be producing/sending to your form submitters.

Discover more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting this [helpful article](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/156-basic-document-vs-stand-alone-document?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms)


**Step 4:**
*Set up a Stand Alone Document*
Using your new blank WordPress page, you will then need to produce a Stand Alone Document and then connect the WordPress page to our Stand Alone Document.

Find out more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting [documentation page](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/137-stand-alone-documents-add-on?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) for this add-on.


**Step 5:**
*(optional) Input Fluent Forms User Details into a Contract*


This step will be different depending on the desired outcome you want. Approve Me's Digital Signature is triggered once a WP Form is submitted. This add-on gives you the power to incorporate WP Form user info (which was inputted from the customer once the form was submitted) into a brand new contract form which will either be emailed to the customer or shown to the customer after they submit the form.


**How to use Fluent Forms to add form fields details into a contract**


Go to the Signer Input Fields/Custom Fields symbol and choose "WP Form Data".


Choose the WP Form that you’ve already made (and want to link with your contract form) using the drop down option list.

Pick the field info you want to include in your new contract.

A shortcode is created using this data. Don’t worry — your customer will only see the real field value when signing your contract.

This is an example of the auto-generated shortcode which will get placed in the document you are producing when you select your desired field value from your WP Form.


[esig fluentform id="3" field_id="1" ]


You can easily transfer the shortcode to any place in your contract form.  It will show the customer’s provided info anywhere the shortcode is found.


**Step 6:**
*Select your document preferences and save settings*

When you have inserted all of your required contract text and have linked your preferred Fluent Forms field data to your Stand Alone Document, you’re ready to choose your document settings.

Note: Before you can post your contract form, you also have to link your Stand Alone Document with the blank WordPress webpage you made previously for your contract. Do this by looking for and choosing the webpage from the "Display on this page" drop down option list found under the "Document Options" area. We decided NOT to include this page in your nav menu since it will be connected to a WP Form and will not work properly unless it has the field values of that submitted WP Form.


**Step 7:**
*Almost there… (halfway done)*
Once you've published your Stand Alone Document, you’re halfway done. In the next step you have to pick your "trigger" and "action" selections for this document in Fluent Forms.


Select LET'S GO NOW! to establish those final Fluent Forms preferences.


**Step 8:**
*Finalize creating the WP Form workflow/trigger*

We’re coming to the end!  Now all you need to do is select your contract and your preferred actions once the workflow is activated.

Go to the “Forms" tab located in the WordPress control panel.

Select the form you attached to the Stand Alone Document.

Choose the "esignature" choice within the contact form options and specify the remaining options.

Now You're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I collect legally binding court recognized Digital Signature from my WordPress website when someone submits a WordPress Form? =

With the Fluent Forms Digital Signature Add-on by ApproveMe, along with a [WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) license you can easily collect [UETA/ESIGN compliant](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms) signatures from your visitors or website customers after they submit a WP Form on your website.

**You can even pass details from the submitted WP Form into your document using this WordPress contract plugin.**

= Are Digital Signature and esignature Legal? =

Yes, electronic digital signatures are legally binding in the United States and many countries around the world.  **United States** in the US there are two digital signature Acts that established the legality of digital signatures in the US – the [Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act) (ESIGN, 2000) and the [Uniform Electronic Transactions Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Electronic_Transactions_Act) (UETA, 1999). Both the ESIGN and UETA establish that electronic records and signatures carry the same weight and legal effect as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures, they say “A document or signature cannot be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” *The ApproveMe WordPress e-signature plugin is UETA/ESIGN compliant.*

**United Kingdom**
In the UK, similar legislation to the ESIGN Act in the USA was likewise settled in 2000, and is known as the UK Electronic Communication Act. 

**European Union**
The appropriation of the European Directive 1999/93/EC of 13 December 1999 established a the utilization of electronic marks on electronic and digital contracts inside of the European Union (EU). Thirty European nations (EU-27, Croatia, Turkey and Liechtenstein) have officially adopted Directive 1999/93/EC. To that end Electronic and Digital marks are effectively being used in Europe, and **ApproveMe’s compliant WordPress e-signature plugin is legitimately acceptable and enforceable within the European Union when it is properly configured.**  One of the best ways to ensure your document is EU compliant is to utilize our “Send Custom Contract Invitation via Email” feature.  So when a user submits your WordPress Form they will be emailed a custom email invitation to sign their unique contract.

= Will I Need to Renew my ApproveMe WordPress E-Signature License? =

Yes you will (unless you have an Lifetime License). Each license key is valid for one calendar year from the purchase date. An active license key is needed for access to automatic/critical updates, plugin support and access to our growing [eSignature add-on library](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms).  

= Where Can I Find My ApproveMe WP esign License Key? =

If you’ve already purchased a license key and need to retrieve the license number, you can do that on the [support site here](https://www.approveme.com/profile/) or follow [these detailed steps](https://wpe.approveme.com/article/141-install-and-activate-plugins-extensions?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms). Once you’ve successfully logged into the support site (using the credentials emailed to you at the time of purchase), your active license key(s) will be listed at the bottom of the page.

= What do I get with my ApproveMe WordPress Signature license =

Your license grants you access to all of our support resources, documentation, product downloads and basic and advanced add-ons like Stand Alone Documents, Document Templates, Unlimited Sender Roles and others, (which are required for this Fluent Forms Wordpress e-signature Plugin) for one calendar year from your purchase date.

[You can get an Elite license here](https://www.approveme.com/fluent-forms-special-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=fluent-forms)

= How much does it cost to renew my license? =

The Lifetime Plan does not have a renewal cost.  It is a one-time payment for the WP E-Signature plugin.  However all other plans have an annual renewal.  Our goal has always been to pull the price back as much as we possibly can so small businesses and freelancers could sign documents electronically using their WordPress website (and save alot of money in the process). Not only is our WordPress signature plugin the most powerful of its kind, it’s also the most affordable.  Not to throw anyone under the bus, but look at what our competitors charge every single year:

Adobe charges $1,080 / yr (per 3 users)
Docusign charges $1,440 / yr (per 3 users)

Not charing for renewals would actually hurt the product as we would not be able to invest as heavily as we currently do back into it...

= What do I get for renewing my license? =

Renewing your license provides an additional year of support and software updates. This provides peace of mind knowing you can turn to us for WP Electronic Signature related support and assistance. You’ll also continue receiving software updates to ensure WordPress compatibility (and security) as well as great new features and enhancements! Also (depending on your license) as we release new basic and premium add-ons you will be able download these at anytime.
